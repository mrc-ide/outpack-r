##' Add a new location - a place where other packets might be found
##' and pulled into your local archive.  Currently only file-based
##' locations are supported.
##'
##' We currently support two types of locations - `path`, which points
##' to an outpack archive accessible by path (e.g., on the same
##' computer or on a mounted network share) and `http`, which requires
##' that an outpack server is running at some url and uses an HTTP API
##' to communicate. More types may be added later, and more
##' configuration options to these location types will definitely be
##' needed in future.
##'
##' Configuration options for different location types:
##'
##' **Path locations**:
##'
##' * `path`: The path to the other archive root. This should
##'   generally be an absolute path, or the behaviour of outpack will
##'   be unreliable.
##'
##' **HTTP locations**:
##'
##' Accessing outpack over HTTP requires that an outpack server is
##'   running. The interface here is expected to change as we expand
##'   the API, but also as we move to support things like TLS and
##'   authentication.
##'
##' * `url`: The location of the server, including protocol, for
##'   example `http://example.com:8080`
##'
##' @section Warning:
##'
##' The API here may change as we move to support different types of
##'   locations.
##'
##' @title Add a new location
##'
##' @param name The short name of the location to use.  Cannot be in
##'   use, and cannot be one of `local` or `orphan`
##'
##' @param type The type of location to add. Currently supported
##'   values are `path` (a location that exists elsewhere on the
##'   filesystem) and `http` (a location accessed over outpack's http
##'   API).
##'
##' @param args Arguments to the location driver. The arguments here
##'   will vary depending on the type used, see Details.
##'
##' @param priority The priority of the location. This is used when
##'   deciding where to pull packets from
##'   ([outpack::outpack_location_pull_packet]), and will be used in
##'   the query interface. A priority of 0 corresponds to the same
##'   priority as local packets, while larger numbers have higher
##'   priority and negative numbers have lower priority.  Ties will be
##'   resolved in an arbitrary order.
