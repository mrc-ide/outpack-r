\usage{
outpack_search(..., parameters = NULL, options = NULL, root = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Arguments passed through to \link{outpack_query}, perhaps
just a query expression}

\item{parameters}{Optionally, a named list of parameters to substitute
into the query (using the \verb{this:} prefix)}

\item{options}{Optionally, a \link{outpack_search_options}
object for controlling how the search is performed, and which
packets should be considered in scope. If not provided, default
options are used (i.e., \code{outpack::outpack_search_options()})}

\item{root}{The outpack root. Will be searched for from the
current directory if not given.}
}
\value{
A character vector of matching ids. In the case of no
match from a query returning a single value (e.g., \code{latest(...)}
or \code{single(...)}) this will be a character missing value
(\code{NA_character_})
}
\description{
Evaluate a query against the outpack database, returning a vector
of matching packet ids.  Note that by default this only searches
through packets that are unpacked and available for direct use on
this computer; to search within packets known to other locations
(and that we might know about via their metadata) you will need to
use the \code{options} argument.
