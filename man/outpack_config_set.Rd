\usage{
outpack_config_set(..., options = list(...), root = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Named options to set (e.g., pass the argument
\code{core.require_pull_recursive = TRUE})}

\item{options}{As an alternative to \code{...}, you can pass a list of
named options here (e.g., \code{list(core.require_pull_recursive = TRUE)}).  This interface is typically easier to program against.}

\item{root}{The outpack root. Will be searched for from the
current directory if not given.}
}
\value{
Nothing
}
\description{
Set configuration options. Not all can currently be set; this will
be expanded over time. See Details.
}
\details{
Options are set in the order that they are provided.  Currently,
if setting one option fails, no further options will be processed
but previous ones will be (do not rely on this behaviour, it
may change).

Currently you can set:
\itemize{
\item \code{core.require_pull_recursive}
}

See \link{outpack_init} for description of these options.
